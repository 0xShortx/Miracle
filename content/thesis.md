At Project Miracle, we are at the forefront of a pivotal shift, embracing regenerative materials science and open source innovation as key drivers of a sustainable future. Our investment thesis is rooted in the belief that overcoming today's environmental and social challenges requires not just solutions, but transformative, regenerative approaches that fundamentally rethink how we interact with the world.

We're committed to investing in technologies that go beyond sustainability - those that actively contribute to ecological restoration and revitalisation. Our focus extends to companies that develop materials that heal and enhance our ecosystems, rather than simply mitigate damage.

We embrace the principles of open source, fostering an ecosystem of collaboration, knowledge sharing and inclusive innovation. We believe that democratising access to breakthroughs in materials science is critical to accelerating global progress and empowering communities around the world.

Our investment interests are broad but focused. We seek to fund early stage start-ups and research initiatives focused on

Heliogenic Technologies: Startups leveraging innovative heliogenic processes for sustainable living, focusing on renewable energy and eco-friendly solutions.

Sustainable Housing Solutions: Ventures dedicated to creating and implementing sustainable, resilient housing, particularly for areas impacted by climate change or disasters.

Urban Retrofitting and Infrastructure: Projects aimed at modernizing city infrastructures in line with ecological and social sustainability principles, such as the doughnut economic model.

Early to Mid-Stage Startups: Focusing on companies in their early to mid-growth stages that require capital to scale operations and technology in sustainable development.

Climate Resilient Projects: Investments in areas affected by climate change or conflict, emphasizing sustainable and adaptable housing and infrastructure.

Research and Development in Sustainable Technologies: Support for R&D initiatives advancing heliogenic technologies and sustainable urban solutions, including partnerships with research institutions.

Social and Environmental Impact Ventures: Startups that demonstrate a clear commitment to positive societal and environmental impacts, aligning with ethical investment principles.

Open Source Technology Innovations: Companies willing to open source their intellectual property, promoting shared knowledge and collaborative advancement in sustainable technology.

Diverse Sector Investments: Spreading investments across sectors like renewable energy, sustainable construction, waste management, water conservation, and smart urban infrastructure.

Geographic and Technological Diversity: Investing in various regions and a range of technological approaches within sustainable living and urban development to mitigate risks and capitalize on diverse opportunities.

In essence, our thesis is a bold call to action. We are committed to supporting and scaling innovations that hold the promise of a more resilient, equitable and prosperous world. At Project Miracle, we're not just investors; we're catalysts for the profound and necessary change our planet desperately needs.
